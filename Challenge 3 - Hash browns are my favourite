So, to set the scene.  It's a late Friday night.  You're hunched over your hackstation in a dark hoodie and drink of choice.  
(Personally, I'm a Malibu and Coke kind of person but that's not everyone's cup of tea...)

Anyway, you're hacking an admin dashboard and Burp has thrown up a hash:

bf2e03325fa76da3e1d97da94991c391

You've enumerated the website and the "Forgotten password?" link for the admin logon has given you the password hint "Password starts with iloveoucss"
You've checked the JS and it gives you password rules --> 10-15 characters a-z0-9.

Crack the hash and get the flag from the ZIP file.
